Yes 👍 — Pebble is a solid choice for your **first MVP**. It’s the storage engine CockroachDB built after they moved off RocksDB, so it’s battle-tested and maintained in Go.

Here’s how you can think about it for v1:

---

## 🧩 MVP with Pebble (single instance)

### 1. **Server process**

* You build a Go server that embeds **Pebble**.
* Expose a simple API (REST + WebSocket) to:

  * Append messages (`POST /messages`)
  * Fetch threads or room history (`GET /rooms/:id/messages`)
  * Subscribe to new messages in real time (WS channel per room).

### 2. **Data model**

Pebble is a KV store, so you’ll design a **key schema**:

```
/rooms/{room_id}/threads/{thread_id}/messages/{msg_id}
/messages/{msg_id}/meta/version/{n}
/messages/{msg_id}/reactions/{reaction_id}
```

* Keys are lexicographically ordered → you can “range scan” to paginate.
* Append = just write a new KV.
* Edits = new version key with delta.
* Reactions = separate reaction keys referencing the message.

### 3. **Client connections**

* Clients (web/mobile) connect over HTTP/WS to your server.
* Reads/writes all go through that server, which talks to Pebble.
* For now, **no clustering** — one server is the authority.

### 4. **Realtime**

* Keep it lightweight:

  * In-memory pub/sub (map of room\_id → connections).
  * On append, write to Pebble → notify subscribers.
* Later, when you cluster, this becomes distributed pub/sub.

### 5. **Tooling**

* CLI: `progress-cli insert`, `progress-cli tail room=123`.
* Web viewer: simple React UI showing rooms, messages, live updates.
* Debugging: dump Pebble keys to JSON for inspection.

## 🔜 Next Steps After Single-Node

* **Replication / HA** → not built into Pebble, so eventually you’ll wrap it with Raft or swap to FoundationDB if you want clustering.
* **Vector search** → you can store embeddings as part of message metadata and integrate with a vector index later.
* **Export/snapshots** → just dump Pebble SSTables or stream KV pairs out for backups.

---

⚡️ Bottom line:
Yes — you can absolutely build a **single-instance Progress.dev MVP with Pebble**.

* Ship a Go binary with embedded Pebble.
* Add REST/WS API.
* Provide CLI + Web viewer.

That’s enough to prove the **append-only, threaded, real-time chat database** idea.

Want me to draft a **key schema + Go code snippet** to show how Pebble can store and paginate a thread in this MVP?
