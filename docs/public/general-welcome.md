# Welcome to ProgressDB

ProgressDB is a fast, purpose-built, chat-native database for AI chat threads. The project includes a database service, backend SDKs (Node, Python), and frontend SDKs (TypeScript, React). This quickstart shows how to run the service locally, install the SDKs, and perform basic operations.

## Why ProgressDB?

ProgressDB is built specifically for chat threads and makes common chat workflows simple and fast:

- Start a thread by sending a message â€” the database will auto-create the thread for you.
- Built-in message versioning, edits, replies, reactions, and soft-deletes.
- Optimized for fast threaded message retrievals and common chat patterns.
- Straightforward encryption and API-key based access controls.
- Ship quickly: small service, simple APIs, and SDKs for Python, Node and frontend use.

ProgressDB removes friction when building chat-first apps or features: fewer transformation layers, direct APIs for threads/messages, and tooling to get you from prototype to production faster.
